# Welcome

I am Helio Rui. I have 5 years of professional experience working as a web/software developer.

I have a bachelor of science in computer science. Also, I like to study about topics related to computer programming, software development process, mathematics, astronomy and more.

I have worked on lots of different projects like ERP systems, websites, Wordpress plugins, Wordpress themes, desktop applications, computer games, android apps, MacOS apps, and even in robotic projects.

To conclude, I am very interested in technology and problem solving. You can click on the icons below to checkout either my Github, or my Linkedin.
