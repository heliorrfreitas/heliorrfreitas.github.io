                These days ago someone asked me how to count the amount of a specific word in one or more files using bash. At the time, I did not know the answer. Later, when I had my time, I started searching about this new mystery for me. I ended up learning a lot more than I initially expected. And as a result of this search I was able to find out how to do that magic trick.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, I had to use a gnu/linux terminal to accomplish this task. This terminal receives the name of Bash which stands for Bourne Again SHell. It was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)">Brian Fox</a> for the GNU project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to learn to search for words in one file. So I created a file and initialized it with the string 'wwwww'. After that I just had to be in that folder and run the command to search and count that string. So, I searched for possible answers for this problem. I found the solution on stackoverflow. I just had to run the command <code>grep -roh wwwww |wc -w</code> and it would return the number of times that word was found in all the files present in the current directory and its subdirectories. It was cool, it actually worked. I tested more times with different cases like increasing the number of files, making the string I wanted to search appear several times in the same line, and so on. They all worked. However, just making it work was not enough for me. I wanted to understand what was going on. So I decided to break it into parts.
            </p>
            <h4>The command grep</h4>
            <p>
                Grep is a command that allows the user to search for patterns in files. It is the command that will look for a specific regular expression in one or more files. It all depends of what options we use when using the command. In the solution for the problem I had, I used the options <b>r</b>,<b>o</b>, and <b>h</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>r - stands for recursive.</li>
                    <li>o - it prints only the values that matched.</li>
                    <li>h - it surpress the prefixing of files names on output.</li>
                </ul>
                I learned this by running the command <code>man grep</code>. This command shows the manual of the command grep. The command <code>man</code> can also be applied to other commands. It will print their manual. It is very handy. One of the best things I learned in this solution hunting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result of just running the command <code>grep -roh wwwww</code> though is the following:<br>
                <code>wwwww</code><br>
                Ok! That is great. It worked and found the string I was looking for. However, it did not return a number of the amount. Instead it returned the occurance of the string I was looking for. This is ok for one case, but and if it was a thousand? I would not want to count that myself. So let's tell the computer to count it for us.
            </p>
            <h4>The command wc</h4>
            <p>
                Wc is a command that counts the number of bytes, characters, whitespace-separated words, and newlines.<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/wc-invocation.html#wc-invocation">Reference here</a>.
                To solve my problem I had to count the number of whitespace-separated words. To achieve this I used the option <code>-w</code>. The whole command used was <code>wc -w</code>. I ran just this piece of code by itself, however this way it was taking too long to show a result. Then I used a file, and it worked really fast. Like this: <code>wc -w file.txt</code>.
            </p>
            <h4>Putting it together</h4>
            <p>
                What is that character, | (vertical bar, or pipe), doing in between the codes? <br>
                That is a pipe, and what it is doing is really cool! Remember when we ran just the command
                <code>grep -roh wwwww</code> and it printed the result in the terminal for us to see?. Using pipe instead of printing the result in the terminal, it uses the output of the first command as input in the second one. Therefore, the command <code>wc -w</code> counted the amount of words resulted from the first command. Then, it finally returned the amount of words and printed it in the terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
                To conclude, there is a lot more to learn about those topics. Regular expressions, pipes, gnu/linux, all them are very powerful and have several use cases. Finding the answer for the problem was just a glance into this knowledge. For now though, this is good. Have a good one!
            </p>
