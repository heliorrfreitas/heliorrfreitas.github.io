The terminal is a program that allows the user to interact with the shell.

It looks like the image above. 

It takes the input and send to the shell, once the shell is done processing it, it returns the output to the user. It is pretty much a way to interact with the computer.

Linux machines, usually, come with at least one terminal emulator. Fedora, comes with the gnome-terminal installed by default. 

Ok, but what is the Shell? 

The Shell is another program that makes the brigde between the user and the operating system. It takes the input entered by the user, evaluates it, executes an action, and returns the result to be displayed on the terminal.
