# Neuroplasticity

## What is neuroplasticity?

This is the name given for the process of neurons establishing connections between themselves.

Neuroplasticity is different of neurogenesis.

## Then, what is neurogenesis?

Neurogenesis is the capacity of the brain of creating new neurons.

## What is a neuron?

A neuron is one of two types of brain cells.The other type is named glial cells.

The following is a quick definition of these two types of brain cells:

- neurons: the basic function unit of our neurosystem and through which information is passed along
- glial cells: they have a supporting role. They are essential to the correct functioning of the brain. They have several responsibilities including: insulation, removal of dead cells, blood flow regulation, etc.

Neurons are formed by the 5 different structures, they are the following:

- dendrite: this part surrounds the nucleus. It looks like a bunch of roots, or branches, they receive the messages from other neurons
- nucleus: controls the synthesis of proteins and other functions
- axon: the axon is the part that looks like a tail
- myelin sheath: it is the part that wraps around the axon
- axon terminals: this part looks like a branch at the end of the neuron

### Notes on the neuron's parts:

The axon looks like a kind of tail. It is also covered with myelin. The myelin, whatever it is or its purpose, looks like helps the message go through faster and more efficiently. The axon terminals are at the end and looks like some branches. When the information gets to the tip of a neuron (the axon terminals I assume) it sends the information to the dendrite of the next neuron. This is called a synapse.
