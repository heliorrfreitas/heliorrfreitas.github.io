# Pair programming (WIP)

### What is pair programming?

### What is ping pong programming?

Ping pong programming happens when two developers alternate between driver and navigator during the development of some code.

It is a way to mix pair programing with TDD. It happens when 2 developer alternate between writing parts of the tests and parts of the code(RED, GREEN, REFACTOR).

For example, developer A and developer B

A - writes test that fails

B - writes enough code to make it pass

A - refactor the test to make it better

B - writes test that fails

A - writes enough code to make it pass

B - refactor the test to make it better

...And so on.

Also in reality it is a lot more interactive than each developer working in a single step of the process while the other ones watches. Usually devs debate ideas when pairing which is good. Constantly changing the driver and navigator is good though because it (should)keeps both devs engaged.
