# Pair programming (WIP)




what is ping pong programming?
mixing pair programing with tdd. 
It is when 2 developers or more alternate between writing parts of the tests(RED, GREEN, REFACTOR)

For example: we have 2 developers. Developer A and developer B

A - writes test that fails
B - writes enough code to make it pass
A - refactor the test to make it better
B - writes test that fails
A - writes enough code to make it pass
B - refactor the test to make it better
