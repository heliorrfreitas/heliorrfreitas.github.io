# Test Driven Development (TDD)  (WIP)



Basics of TDD.

What is the advantage of writing tests first?
One must trully understand what he or she is implementing in order to implement it well. Writing tests firsts helps the developer to think about the design of the code may look like before it is written. It gives direction when following the RED, GREEN, REFACTOR cycle, and once the tests are complete, it is like a small specification of how the code should behave was created. TDD gives confidence when making changes, and help newcomers to understand the expected behaviour of the code. 

Does it always help? 


Should I write it first or write ir last?

Why?
