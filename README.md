My personal blog README


This blog is built using github pages and jekyll. 

You have to have Ruby install in the machine. 

Also, I used bundler to handle the dependencies. 

To install the dependencies:
```
bundle install
```

To run it locally run the following command:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
